=head1 NAME

RPC::Serialized::Handler::YATG::Retrieve - RPC handler for YATG::Retrieve::Disk

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements an L<RPC::Serialized> handler for
L<YATG::Retrieve::Disk>.  There is no special configuration, and all received
parameters are passed on to C<YATG::Retrieve::Disk::retrieve()> verbatim.

=head1 INSTALLATION

You'll need to run an RPC::Serialized server, of course, and configure it
to serve this handler. There are files in the C<examples/> folder of this
distribution to help with that, e.g. C<rpc-serialized.server.yml>:

 ---
 # configuration for rpc-serialized server with YATG handlers
 rpc_serialized:
     handlers:
         yatg_store:    "RPC::Serialized::Handler::YATG::Store"
         yatg_retrieve: "RPC::Serialized::Handler::YATG::Retrieve"
 net_server:
     port: 1558
     user: daemon
     group: daemon

You should head over to the RPC::Serialized documentation to learn how to
set that up. We use a pre-forking L<Net::Server> based implementation to
receive port traffic data and store to disk, then serve it back out to CGI on
a web server.
