=head1 NAME

YATG::Retrieve::RPC - Retrieve a set of polled data over the network

=head1 VERSION

version 4.112530

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can load this module to retrieve a set of data which has previously been
stored by L<YATG::Store::Disk> or L<YATG::Store::RPC>. An implementation of
this process is given in the CGI bundled with this distribution, which
displays results of SNMP polls.

There is not a lot to describe - it's a very lightweight call which throws
data to an instance of L<YATG::Retrieve::Disk> on another system, so read the
manual page for that module for more information.

You must of course configure C<yatg_updater> with the location of the RPC
service (see below).

Also see L<RPC::Serialized::Handler::YATG::Retrieve> for guidance on setting
up the remote RPC server.

The parameter signature for the C<retrieve> subroutine is the same as that for
C<YATG::Store::Retrieve::retrieve()>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

In the main C<yatg_updater> configuration, you need to specify the location of
the remote RPC service. Follow the example in the bundled C<yatg.yml> example
file.

You can also override some default settings of L<RPC::Serialized>. For
instance the default serializer is set to L<YAML::Syck> so to change that try:

 rpc_serialized_client_inet:
    data_serializer:
        serializer: 'JSON::Syck'
